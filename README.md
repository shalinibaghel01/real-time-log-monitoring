🚀 Real-Time Log Monitoring and Alerting System on AWS

This project is a production-grade real-time log monitoring and alerting solution built using AWS services and DevOps automation tools. It enables centralized log collection, live alerting, and visual dashboards to monitor applications and infrastructure.


📌 Project Overview

Project Name: Real-Time Log Monitoring and Alerting SystemGoal: Automatically collect logs, detect anomalies, trigger alerts, and visualize metrics in real time using fully automated infrastructure.

🧱 Architecture Components

1. Application Logs

Logs generated by the application running on EC2 or containers.

Logs can include errors, warnings, and custom events.

2. CloudWatch Logs

Centralized log collection from applications.

Logs are grouped and streamed to trigger Lambda.

3. Lambda Function

Custom Python logic to parse and filter logs.

Sends alerts for critical logs via SNS.

Stores critical info to RDS.

4. Amazon SNS

Sends email/SMS alerts when a log anomaly is detected.

5. S3 Bucket

All logs are archived for long-term storage.

6. RDS (MySQL)

Stores critical log events from Lambda function.

7. Prometheus + Grafana

Prometheus scrapes metrics (CPU, RAM, Disk, custom log metrics).

Grafana visualizes real-time dashboards.

8. Terraform

Provisions all AWS infrastructure in one command.

9. Ansible

Configures Grafana server with Docker, Prometheus, Grafana setup.

⚙️ Deployment Workflow

🔹 Step 1: Setup

cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply

Provisions: EC2, Lambda, RDS, CloudWatch, S3, SNS


🔹 Step 2: EC2 Config with Ansible

cd ansible
ansible-playbook -i inventory install.yml

Installs: Docker, Prometheus, Grafana containers


🔹 Step 3: Grafana Dashboard

Access Grafana at http://<EC2-Public-IP>:3000

Import dashboard using dashboard.json

Prometheus automatically connects as datasource


📈 Sample Metrics in Grafana

✅ CPU / Memory / Disk Usage per EC2 instance

✅ Real-time Error Log Count (Custom Metric)

✅ Lambda Function Invocation Metrics

✅ Alerts Panel via SNS


🔔 Alert Flow

[CloudWatch Logs] → [Lambda Trigger] → [SNS Topic] → [Email/SMS Alert]
                                    ↘ [RDS + S3 Save]


📬 Email Alert Preview

Subject: [ALERT] Error in application logs
Body:
  Timestamp: 2025-06-20
  Source: /app/logs
  Error Message: CRITICAL database timeout


🔐 Security & Access

IAM roles strictly scoped for Lambda

Public access limited to Grafana port 3000

SSH access via key pair only
